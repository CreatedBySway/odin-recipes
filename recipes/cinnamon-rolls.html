    <h4>On first glance these homemade cinnamon rolls may not look like anything out of the ordinary.</h4>
    <p>Buttery, golden brown yeasted dough, check; delicious cinnamon–brown sugar filling, check; decadent cream cheese icing, check. But we’re putting it all on the line to wager that this recipe, thanks to a few choice tactical twists, produces the best, most ooey-gooey, perfectly fluffy from-scratch buns you’ll ever make.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
         <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
         <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
         <li>1 packet (2 1/4 tsp) active dry yeast</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
         <li>1 cup whole milk, warmed</li>
         <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
         <li>2 large eggs</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
         <li>1/2 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
         <li>1/2 cup cream cheese, softened</li>
         <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of flour, sugar, yeast, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix the warmed milk, melted butter, and eggs. Add to the dry ingredients and mix until combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the remaining flour until a soft dough forms. Knead for about 5 minutes until smooth.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough into a rectangle, spread with softened cream cheese, and sprinkle with cinnamon and brown sugar.</li>
        <li>Roll up tightly and cut into 12 equal pieces. Place in a greased baking dish.</li>
        <li>Cover and let rise again for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>For the icing, mix powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and a little milk until smooth. Drizzle over warm rolls before serving.</li>
    </ol>
